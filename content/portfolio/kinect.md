During my junior year I decided to take a break from all things web and to focus my energy on combining my two passions, coding and dance. I designed a private study in which I created a dance piece that utilized a dancer’s motion to manipulate and generate audio. I used a Kinect to capture video and processed it using Synapse and MAX.

My piece was performed at Oberlin’s Student Dance Showcase. The piece would not have been possible without Jon Bellona’s Kinect-via-Synapse and Synapse.

The video below is of the second performance, the audio was generated and recorded live.
